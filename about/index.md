title: About James
---


James is a physicist and progammer active in Boston/Cambridge MA and Ithaca NY. He is currently working on his PhD as a graduate student in the Department of Physics at Cornell. He graduated from Northeastern University with his BS in Physics in 2014.


##Physics

James is currently focusing his studies in the field of Accelerator Physics as a graduate student in the [SRF group](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/Research/SRF/WebHome.html).

In 2013, as a Northeastern student, James worked at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/) upgrading the ME 1/1 chambers on the [CMS detector](http://cms.web.cern.ch/). James also worked in other physics lab groups at Northeastern in 2010 and 2011.


##Programming

On the programming side of things, James specializes in web-development, with attention to back-end programming and relational databases. He is most experienced in Ruby on Rails and Django, but he doesn't want to tie himself to any framework in particular (just as a good builder doesn't tie himself to one color of brick). James is a technical consultant for [Wrongcards](http://wrongcards.com) and with a team of other programmers has developed a new web application for the [Biomod](http://www.biomod.net) competition.

From 2011 to 2013, James worked as a staff programmer and web developer in the [Wall Lab at Harvard Medical School](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) (recently relocated to Stanford).
